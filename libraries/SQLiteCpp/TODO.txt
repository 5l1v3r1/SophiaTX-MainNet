C++11 explicit support

Update Doxygen Documentation, but remove it from the master branch
Publish the Doxygen Documentation in the Github Pages (gh-pages branch)

Missing features in v0.5.0:
- bind a SQLITE_STATIC value (string/blob)
- bind a dynamic value with zerocopy (unlike SQLITE_TRANSIENT) with custom deleter
- getColumnByName ? std::map getRow() ?

Missing documentation in v0.5.0:
- This wrapper is not thread safe : compare to the thread safety of the SQLite3 library

Advanced missing features:
- backup support to/from file/:memory:
- batch mode managing multiple queries semicolon separated ? 
- Function ?
- Agregate ?
- support for different transaction mode ? NO: too specific
- operator<< binding ? NO: redundant with bind()
- ATTACH Database ? NO: can already be done by "ATTACH" Statement

Add a full test suite

Add optional usage of experimental sqlite3_trace() function to enable statistics 

Add a comparison of others C++ wrappers (code style, C++ design, in code documentation, tests, online documentation, examples, license, UTF-16) 

Post an article to CodeProject : Is there a license issue ?
Mirror the repository to GoogleCode : with a versionned downloadable ZIP file

Documentation:
- explain the noncopyable property for RAII design
- comment on returning error code instead of exception that shall not be thrown when exepected (!?)
